# Planning the Workload Migration

An organization needs to determine what outcomes and value they will get from moving workloads to the cloud. Determining that will help to define which workloads will go to the cloud and how to prioritize them through a program of change or roadmap. Having defined the Cloud strategy and goals, an organization is ready to initiate the process of assessing those workloads for suitability and deployment to the cloud.

## Guidance

If you want to just migrate a data center to the cloud, then go straight to the technical migration
If you want to prioritize workloads and determine which applications should move first, then do a business assessment and portfolio analysis to determine the prioritization (reword)
