# Defining a Cloud Strategy

The Cloud Strategy needs to be defined as a first step in planning your migration to the cloud.

## Guidance

The Cloud Strategy document:
* Includes a summary of drivers, challenges, business, and end-user requirements
* Defines why Cloud and why now and the benefits to the business of leveraging the cloud
* Documents business objectives and targets to be achieved from cloud use
* Defines how Cloud adoption success will be measured
* Identifies challenges and risks
* Defines Cloud for the organization - attributes, service models
* Identifies the Cloud Program Team or Cloud Competency Center structure
* Documents the cloud Strategy for consumption, building, securing, and managing hybrid applications

In order to achieve this objective the following high-level recommendations are provided:
• Commit to a Cloud Readiness journey – This will require allocation of resources, time and management commitment.  The sustained effort   will only occur with an organizational commitment
• Form a cloud program team – The efforts required cross organizational boundaries, and are multi-factored.  As a result a team needs to   be created with a focus on achieving the desired results.
• Include the business as stakeholders in the process – Organizations that are successful in cloud adoption have strong business       
  commitment and involvement in the process.
• Engage Application support and release management – Changes to the application development, support, and release management processes 
  will form a core part of the readiness required to adopt the cloud.
• Engage current Service providers to participate – leverage existing relationships and partnerships with existing technology 
  suppliers that need to engage in the process and may form a vital part of the cloud hosting eco-system.
• Treat the adoption and readiness as a program with projects covering
	o Contracts
	o Service Management
	o Security and compliance
	o Operations Readiness
	o Application development 
	o Infrastructure

## Preparation
1. Identify the Cloud program team
2. Identify key business and technical stakeholders
3. Identify the Application support and release management team
4. Engage with strategic service providers

## Procedure

1. Assemble a team of business and technical stakeholders as identified in the preparation phase. This team should include application 
   owners and IT service delivery managers. Leverage a workshop format to complete the Cloud Strategy document.
2. Develop the Cloud Strategy Document, which clearly defines the cloud objectives for the organization.
